# Handwritten Digit Classification with Neural Networks

## Introduction
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Keras (included in TensorFlow)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Seaborn (for heatmap visualization)

### Installation
To install the required dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn

Running the Project
To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:
