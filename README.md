# Handwritten Digit Classification with Neural Networks

## Introduction
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Keras (included in TensorFlow)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Seaborn (for heatmap visualization)

### Installation
To install the required dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Project
To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:
```bash
python handwritten_digit_classification.py
```


# Explanation
## Data Loading
The MNIST dataset is loaded using keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(), which splits the data into training and testing sets.
Training images are reshaped to work with CNNs, which expect 3D tensors.
Model Architecture
The model follows a sequential architecture with these layers:

## Convolutional Layers (Conv2D):

Two layers to extract spatial features.
32 filters in the first layer, 64 in the second, with a 3x3 kernel size.
ReLU activation for non-linearity.
Max Pooling Layers (MaxPooling2D):

Two layers to reduce dimensionality using 2x2 pool size for downsampling.
Flatten Layer:

Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector for the fully-connected layer.
Dense Layer (Hidden Layer):

Fully-connected layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation for feature learning.
Output Layer (Dense):

Fully-connected layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) using softmax activation for probability output.


## Model Training
The model uses the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.
Trained for 10 epochs with model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10).


## Model Evaluation
Evaluated on the test set using model.evaluate(X_test, y_test) to measure accuracy and loss.
Prediction and Visualization
Predictions are made on the test data.

### A confusion matrix is generated using tf.math.confusion_matrix and visualized with seaborn heatmaps to show correct and incorrect classifications.

## Additional Notes

You can experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of filters, hidden layer size, training epochs) for better performance.
Consider data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Further Exploration
Experiment with advanced architectures like VGG16 or ResNet for potentially higher accuracy.
Use preprocessing techniques like normalization for better input representation.
Visualize learned features using filter visualization techniques.
